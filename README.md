# graph
BFS can be helpful when,
• We want to find the shortest path from any source to destination.
• You want to find there exist a path between two nodes.
• Bipartite Graph
• If you feel the solution exists in fewer levels instead of going deep..

DFS can be helpful when,
• We want to exhaust all possibilities, and check which is best.
• We need to count all possible paths from source to destination.
• Backtracking.
